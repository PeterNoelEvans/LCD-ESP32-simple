# LCD-ESP32-Simple

This project demonstrates how to use an ESP32 to control a 16x2 LCD display with an I2C backpack using MicroPython.

## Files
- `machine_i2c_lcd.py`: The library for controlling the LCD.
- `test.py`: Example script to display text on the LCD.
- `README.md`: This file.
- `scan_i2c.py` : This will allow you to check if the I2C is working.

## Getting Started
- Ensure you have MicroPython installed on your ESP32.
- Upload the files to your ESP32 using Thonny or another MicroPython IDE.
- Modify `test.py` as needed to suit your setup.
